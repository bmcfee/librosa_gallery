## Contribute

If you want to contribute a cool application or educational example, you need
to take care of a few steps:

* Meet all dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`).
* It's easy to start with a Jupyter Notebook (optional).
* We use `sphinx_gallery` to create the output.
* Create a new python file in `examples`.
* Go to `docs/` and run `make html`.
